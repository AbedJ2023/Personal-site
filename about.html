        <h2>Web Developer</h2>

        <p>
          Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the
          work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work
          fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding
          languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they
          are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too
          – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest
          accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional
          university degree to become qualified.
        </p>
        <p>
          The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end
          (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side).

        <h2>Work Out</h2>

          We have all heard it many times before - regular exercise is good for
          you, and it can help you lose weight. But if you are like many
          Americans, you are busy, you have a sedentary job, and you haven't yet
          changed your exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too
          late to start. You can start slowly, and find ways to fit more
          physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit, you should
          try to get the recommended amount of exercise for your age. If you can
          do it, the payoff is that you will feel better, help prevent or
          control many diseases, and likely even live longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone can benefit from physical activity. For most people, it is
          possible to begin exercising on your own at a slow pace. If you have
          never exercised before, start with a 10-minute period of light
          exercise. A brisk walk every day is a good first exercise. Slowly
          increase how hard you exercise and for how long.

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <img
          class="photo-picture"

          alt="photography"
        />
        <p>
          Photography is the art, science, and practice of creating durable
          images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either
          electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of
          a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.
        </p>
        <p>
          In today’s digital world, photographers use state-of-the-art cameras
          and sophisticated software to create stunning images. But photography
          is not just about high-tech tools. The heart of photography is the
          creative process, and the skill and artistry of the photographer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone with a camera can take a picture. But to create truly great
          images, you need to understand the principles of photography, and have
          a creative eye and a sense of composition. With practice, you can
          develop your own unique style, and become a better photographer.
