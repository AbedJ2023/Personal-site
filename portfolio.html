        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>

        <p>
          You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really
          simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really
          wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't
          quite as simple as you think!
        </p>
        <p>
          Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead
          and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do
          next.
        </p>
        <p>
          To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a
          little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to
          do to win.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three X in a
          row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer
          from getting three Os in a row. After you put an X in a square, you
          start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X You look
          at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choices—which ones
          might let you make three X in a row.

        <h2>Basketball Game</h2>
        <img

        />
        <p>
          basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a
          rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by
          tossing the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal
          hoop and net called a basket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only major sport strictly of U.S. origin, basketball was invented
          by James Naismith (1861–1939) on or about December 1, 1891, at the
          International Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School
          (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith
          was an instructor in physical education.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that first game of basketball in 1891, Naismith used as goals two
          half-bushel peach baskets, which gave the sport its name. The students
          were enthusiastic. After much running and shooting, William R. Chase
          made a midcourt shot—the only score in that historic contest. Word
          spread about the newly invented game, and numerous associations wrote
          Naismith for a copy of the rules, which were published in the January
          15, 1892, issue of the Triangle, the YMCA Training School’s campus
          paper.

        <h2>Restaurant menu</h2>
        <img class="menu-picture" src="./pictures/menu.png" alt="menu" />
        <p>
          Creating a menu seems like a relatively simple thing to do. Just list
          down all the items your Chef can cook for your restaurant, and you’re
          good to go. Except, not! Menu designing is an art and takes a lot of
          effort and calculations to price those items right. Often, restaurant
          owners get so involved in pricing their menu, that they forget the
          aesthetics of it. A well-designed restaurant menu with good restaurant
          menu descriptions can up sell the dishes itself, and influence your
          customers to order more, while a poorly designed menu can hamper your
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create the menu descriptions in such a way that it leaves them
          salivating and ordering for more. An ideal restaurant menu description
          is a short one, explains what the dish is, and, ultimately, makes the
          customer want to order it. Avoid long, incomprehensible food
          descriptions that leave the customers puzzled about what the dish is.
          If customers don’t understand the restaurant menu description, they
          are most likely not to order that item. Hence, this makes it
          imperative that you avoid making these cardinal menu design mistakes.
